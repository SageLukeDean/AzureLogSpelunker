    <h1>AzureLogSpelunker release notes</h1>
    <h2>v1.2.1.0 (2014-12-17)</h2>
    Thanks to Jeff Vega (jvega-sage) for these contributions.
    <ul>
        <li>
            It is now possible to work with WADLogsTables with nonstandard names.
            A "Table" control allows you to select a table name from a list fetched from the Azure
            storage account referenced by the current connection string.  Note that this preference
            is not stored.
        </li>
        <li>New buttons allow moving filters directly to the top or bottom of the list.</li>
        <li>
            Quickfiltering is implemented.  After you've typed a new filter into the box, you may press
            the ENTER key or the new lightning bolt button to immediately apply that filter, in addition
            to any filters already selected to be applied, to the cached dataset.  The Quickfilter is
            temporary.  It is not saved in the list of filters.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.2.0.0 (2014-05-10)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Made with Visual Studio 2013, System.Data.SQLite 1.0.92, and WindowsAzure.Storage 3.2.0</li>
        <li>
            The option to use disk space instead of system memory for temporary SQLite storage was added.
            This allows for larger datasets to be fetched from Azure.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.1.0.0 (2013-12-07)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The number of rows in the SQLite cache is now displayed below the "Fetch from Azure" button.</li>
        <li>
            The SQLite "RowId" column is available in the display grid.
            Use the "Preferences" button below the grid to add it to your view.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.0.0.0 (2013-11-23)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial release</li>
